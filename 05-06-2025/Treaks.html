        Kedarkantha is one of the most loved winter treks in India. It’s perfect for beginners 
        and offers a fairytale experience — snow-covered pine forests, frozen lakes,
         and beautiful sunrise views from the summit. The trail starts from Sankri village and takes you through remote hamlets and quiet mountain woods. On reaching the peak, you’ll witness views of Swargarohini, Bandarpoonch, and Black Peak ranges.
